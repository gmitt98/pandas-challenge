# bootcamp homework for pandas due 4/14/2023

This repo has a main folder called PyCitySchools.
The main notebook for this challenge is PyCitySchools\PyCitySchools.ipynb
The data for this project is in PyCitySchools\Resources

I approached this project by working creating my own empty notebook and following the directions in the module instructions.
I used the sample code provided in the module instructions whent it said to do so.
The sections using ranges (spending, size, budget) onwards use the starter code format.

I went through the starter code which had the expected results in order to verify that I was getting the correct results, and adjusting my code to match.

One big difference between my approach and the provided starter code is that I did not merge the datasets, but rather read both csv files seperately.
This means that there are places where I am joining columns between datasets instead of grouping within a single data set.
In retrospect, the sample code approach would have been simpler.
