    "### Summary\n",
    "Overall, we see that charter schools perform better than District schools on reading and math. This includes both average scores and overall passing percentages.\n",
    "Additionally, the Charter schools have lower per-student spending than the District schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected Findings\n",
    "* Charter schools score better on both reading and math, with a nine in ten students passing in both subjects while district schools score just barely more than half.\n",

    "* Small and medium schools score better than large schools, but this appears to be associated with type, as the top passing schools are all charter schools and the bottom passing schools are all district schools, and the district schools are larger than the charter schools in our performance report.\n",
